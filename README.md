# E-Rack
A smart clothes hanger.

This project is about a smart clothes hanger named E-Rack, which can detect the environment, set the alarm, analyzing data meanwhile being controlled by the user 24/7. It is made for those who spend less time at home, for example, office workers and students. Our proposed E-Rack can detect abnormal weather like rain, snow, sand dust, etc. Then it can send a message to the mobile devices of the user to let them decide whether to retract the hanger. It can also help the user to estimate the remaining time for the clothes to dry.
